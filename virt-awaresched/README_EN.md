# Virtual Aware Scheduler

> This project has been open-sourced in the [openEuler](https://www.openeuler.org/) community. You are welcome to use and contribute to it.

## 📍Overview

Virtual Aware Scheduler (VSched) is a virtualization scheduling optimization service based on the Kunpeng CPU topology. The Kunpeng CPU topology is NUMA > Cluster > Core > CPU (SMP). VSched is designed to minimize cross-cluster scheduling of core-bound virtual machines and reduce vCPU thread drift between CPUs, thereby improving the LLC cache hit ratio and reducing the performance overhead caused by unnecessary vCPU migrations.

## 📌 Quick Start

### Environment Requirements

- OS: openEuler 24.03 LTS SP2 or later is recommended.
- Compilation toolchain: CMake ≥ 3.22, GCC ≥ 9.3
- Dependency library: For details, see [Build Guide](./docs/build_install/BUILD.md).

### Get Code

```bash
git clone https://gitcode.com/openeuler/ubs-virt
cd virt-awaresched
```

### Build the Project

- Build the RPM package in release mode by default (for production deployment).

    ```bash
    bash build.sh package
    ```

- Build the RPM package in debug mode (including debug information).

    ```bash
    bash build.sh -D package
    ```

The build artifacts are located in the `cmake-build-*` directory, and the RPM package is generated in the `output/` directory.

## 🧩 Core Features

- **Collection of information about VMs and CPU topology**<br>
    VSched collects virtual machine information, monitors virtual machine lifecycle events, while also collecting CPU topology information for vCPU scheduling.
- **CPU allocation and defragmentation**<br>
    VSched allocates suitable CPUs to vCPUs within the core binding range of virtual machines based on the cluster topology, minimizing cross-cluster scheduling. When a virtual machine is destroyed, VSched reclaims CPUs and defragments CPU resources.
- **Support for static and dynamic core binding**<br>
    VSched binds vCPU threads to cores statically or dynamically.
    - In static core binding, vCPUs run on designated CPUs.
    - In dynamic core binding, vCPUs run on a preferred core. If the CPU usage of the preferred core exceeds a specified threshold, vCPUs are migrated a better-performing core within the specified range. Dynamic core binding requires the kernel to support the tidal affinity feature.
- **CLI command support**<br>
    VSched provides O&M commands for administrators to query vCPU binding details, modify configurations, and manually trigger rescheduling.

## 🧪 Developer Testing

The project contains complete unit tests (UTs).

- Run UTs only.

    ```bash
    bash build.sh test
    ```

- Run specific test cases.

    ```bash
    bash build.sh test -- --gtest_filter="TestClusterSched.*"
    ```

- Generate a code coverage report.

    ```bash
    # The report will be generated in the ./coverage directory.
    bash build.sh test -C
    ```
